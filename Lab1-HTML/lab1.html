                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p><i>Coffee</i> is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple anecdotal origin stories which lack evidence. In a commonly repeated legend, Kaldi, a 9th-century<br>
                         Ethiopian goatherd, first observed the <b>coffee plant</b> after seeing his flock energized by chewing on the plant.<br>
                          This legend does not appear before 1671, first being related by Antoine Faustus Nairon,a Maronite professor of Oriental<br>
                           languages and author of one of the first printed treatises devoted to coffee, indicating the story is likely apocryphal.<br>
                            Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. Starving after being exiled from Mokha, Omar found berries.<br>
                             After attempting to chew and roast them, Omar boiled them, which yielded a liquid that revitalized and sustained him.

                    <h3>Serving</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once brewed, coffee may be served in a variety of ways. Drip-brewed, percolated, or French-pressed/cafeti√®re coffee<br> may be served as white coffee with a dairy product such as milk or cream, or dairy substitute, or as black coffee with<br> no such addition. It may be sweetened with sugar or artificial sweetener. When served cold, it is called iced coffee.<br>
